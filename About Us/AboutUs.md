# About Us
The open source programs office (OSPO) raises awareness and capacity for open source software to better develop, manage, curate, and share it for research, education, translation, and broader impact.

As a community convener and center of competency, the OSPO aims to build open source capacity within CMU and beyond, leveraging the institution's research, teaching, and policy expertise to maximize its social impact on a global scale.

## OPSO Core Objectives
- Explore open source software and its impact as an underlying component for automated science.
- Examine how both US Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) can develop open source policies, processes and programs.
- Support wider university services such as student internships and open source educational efforts.
- Build the universityâ€™s capacity to curate, manage and share open source software.

## Service Details
The OSPO offers a range of services to assist students, staff, and faculty at different stages of developing, licensing, documenting, and promoting open source projects. These services may include, but are not limited to:

- Introductory education on best practices for open source development and connecting to wider open source communities.
- One-on-one advising sessions for guidance on licensing and available university resources and support. Collaboration and partnership development between internal and external stakeholders on open source projects and initiatives.
